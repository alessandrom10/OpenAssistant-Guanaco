## Tasks Overview

### 1. Data Analysis

- **Dataset Analysis:**
  - Calculated and visualized basic statistics such as average document length and average vocabulary size.
- **Word2Vec Embedding:**
  - Trained a Word2Vec embedding on the data and analyzed its properties.
- **Document Clustering:**
  - Clustered the documents and visualized the clusters to identify groups or known classes.
  - Indexed the documents for keyword search functionality.

### 2. Model Training

- **Fine-Tuning:**
  - Fine-tuned three different models: Meta Llama 2 7B, Meta Llama 3 8B, and Microsoft Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct.
- **Evaluation:**
  - Evaluated and compared the performance of the fine-tuned models against their original versions.

### 3. Extensions

- **Cross-Dataset Evaluation:**
  - Investigated model performance on the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD).
- **Gradio Application:**
  - Developed a Gradio application for user interaction with the fine-tuned Meta Llama 3 8B model on the Guanaco dataset.
  - The application features:
    - A text box for user input.
    - A text box displaying the system response generated by the model.
    - A submit button to trigger the system response.
